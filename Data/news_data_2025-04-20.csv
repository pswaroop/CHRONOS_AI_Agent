"Kash Patel Embraces the Limelight, Unlike Recent F.B.I.

At one, in Washington, Mr. Patel, who has played the sport since he was a child, was spotted in the owner’s suite as he watched the Capitals player Alex Ovechkin tie Mr. Gretzky’s scoring record.

And since taking over the agency, Mr. Patel has been a noticeable presence at President Trump’s side, delivering a warm-up speech at the Justice Department before Mr. Trump himself spoke and hovering behind him during the U.F.C. match in Miami.

Mr. Patel, 44, seems to relish his new status as director, cutting a highly visible path while running the most important law enforcement agency in the nation.

"Thousands across the US protest Trump, again","Thousands join anti-Trump protests across US

Thousands took to the streets across the US on Saturday to protest over recent actions by President Donald Trump. Known as ""50501"", for ""50 protests, 50 states, 1 movement"", the demonstrations were intended to coincide with the 250th anniversary of the start of the American Revolutionary War. From outside the White House and Tesla dealerships and at the centres of many cities, protesters expressed a variety of grievances. Many called for the return of Kilmar Ábrego García, who was mistakenly deported to El Salvador. Political protests are becoming more common in the US - the ""Hands Off"" demonstrations in early April drew tens of thousands in cities across the country.

The most recent polling from Gallup suggests 45% of voters approve of Trump's performance in the first quarter of his term, which is more than the 41% who approved during the same period in his first administration. Still, it is lower than the average first-quarter rating of 60% for all presidents elected between 1952 and 2020. Saturday's protests addressed a number of Trump actions, including those by the Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) - Trump's initiative to cut US government jobs and other spending - and the administration's unwillingness to bring about the return of Ábrego García, a citizen of El Salvador. Gihad Elgendy told CNN he joined the protest at the White House to criticise the deportation of Ábrego García. He believes Trump ""could easily pressure El Salvador to bring him back"". The protests were generally reported as peaceful, although Representative Suhas Subramanyam, a Democrat, posted a video on X of a man holding a Trump sign and pushing through a crowd to angrily confront him. Many demonstrators carried signs reading ""No Kings,"" a nod to the anniversary of the start of the country's revolution against British rule. During celebrations of the anniversary in Massachusetts that commemorated the battles of Lexington and Concord and the famous horse ride of Paul Revere, people held similar signs. There was also a 50501 demonstration in Boston on Saturday. ""This is a very perilous time in America for liberty,"" Thomas Bassford, told the Associated Press, while in Boston with his partner, daughter and two grandsons. ""I wanted the boys to learn about the origins of this country and that sometimes we have to fight for freedom.""

Trump's popularity appears to be edging down, especially when it comes to the economy. When he took office in January, his approval rating was 47%, according to Gallup. His approval rating in a recent Reuters/Ipsos poll similarly dipped to 43% from 47% on Inauguration Day. In the same poll, only 37% approved of his performance on the economy, compared to 42% during inauguration. Earlier this month, hundreds of thousands of Americans gathered for the largest nationwide show of opposition since Trump returned to the White House.

Qatar's chief negotiator says 'frustrated' by pace of Gaza talks,"Qatar's chief negotiator voiced frustration over talks for a truce in Gaza in an interview with AFP, a month after Israel resumed its strikes on the Palestinian territory and another round of negotiations ended without a deal.

""We're definitely frustrated by the slowness, sometimes, of the process in the negotiation. This is an urgent matter. There are lives at stake here if this military operation continues day by day,"" Mohammed Al-Khulaifi said on Friday.

Qatar, with the United States and Egypt, brokered a truce in Gaza between Israel and Hamas which came into force on January 19 and largely halted over a year of war triggered by Palestinian militants' October 7, 2023, attack on Israel.

The initial phase of the truce ended in early March, with the two sides unable to agree on the next steps.

Hamas has insisted that negotiations be held for a second phase to the truce, leading to a permanent end to the war, as outlined in the January framework.

Israel, which had called for an extension to the opening phase, resumed air and ground attacks across the Gaza Strip on March 18 after earlier halting the entry of aid.

Late on Thursday, Hamas signalled the group would not accept Israel's newest proposal for a 45-day ceasefire. Israel had wanted the release of 10 living hostages held by the Palestinian group, the militant group said.

- 'Noise' -

""We've been working continuously in the last days to try to bring the parties together and revive the agreement that has been endorsed by the two sides,"" the Qatari minister of state said.

""And we will remain committed to this, in spite of the difficulties,"" he added.

During the long mediation process, Qatar has been the target of direct criticism from Israel and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

At least two of Netanyahu's aides are suspected of receiving payments from the Qatari government to promote Doha's interests in Israel, prompting an Israeli criminal probe. Qatar has dismissed the attacks as a ""smear campaign"".

Earlier in March, an investigation by Israel's domestic security agency attributed funds from the Gulf state to an increase in Hamas's military strength before the October 7 attack. Qatar has rebuffed the accusation as ""false"".

""We've been receiving those types of criticism and negative comments since the early times of our involvement,"" Al-Khulaifi said.

""Critiques without any context, such as the ones that we keep hearing from Netanyahu himself, are often just noise,"" he added.

Al-Khulaifi rejected recent remarks from Netanyahu to the US-based evangelical Christian channel Daystar that Qatar had promoted ""anti-Americanism and anti-Zionism"" on US college campuses.

- 'De-escalation' -

""His claims about Qatar's educational partnerships have been repeatedly disproven. Everything we do is transparent,"" the Qatari official added.

Qatar, with Al-Khulaifi as its lead negotiator, has emerged as a facilitator in the conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo that has flared in recent months, with the armed M23 group making a series of rapid gains in the country's resource-rich east.

In early March, Congolese President Felix Tshisekedi and his Rwandan counterpart, Paul Kagame, who is accused of backing the M23, held surprise meetings in Doha and later expressed their support for a ceasefire.

""This meeting happened to really find a pathway towards de-escalation and more of an agreement on an implementation mechanism,"" Al-Khulaifi said.

""We've managed to create this flexible line of communication between the two sides, and we're hoping there are more successes than you can hear within the next days,"" the Qatari minister added.

Al-Khulaifi said following the meetings between the leaders that Qatar had convinced the M23, Rwanda and the DRC to ""de-escalate"" near the strategic mining hub of Walikale.

This allowed ""a process of withdrawing from Walikale to the eastern sides, to Goma. That movement by itself was, in our view, a positive development,"" he added, referring to the M23-held capital of DR Congo's North Kivu Province.

Al-Khulaifi said the United States had been ""a reliable partner"" in DR Congo and he hoped to discuss the conflict with the US envoy for Africa, Massad Boulos, in Washington in the coming days.

In the United States, Khulaifi said he would also raise the issue of ongoing sanctions on Syria following the ousting of president Bashar al-Assad.

Along with Qatari funding for gas supplies to Syria, Qatar is discussing with regional partners an increase in public sector salaries in the country.

""We're discussing it very closely with our US colleagues to see, how can we move on within this project,"" Al-Khulaifi said.",['Callum Paton'],,https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2025/04/qatars-chief-negotiator-says-frustrated-pace-gaza-talks,2025-04-20

America's oldest serving astronaut Don Pettit has returned to Earth on his 70th birthday.

Israel's unmanned bulldozers breaking ground in Gaza war,"At first glance, there is nothing unusual about the bulky bulldozer turning up soil at a testing site in central Israel, but as it pulled closer it became clear: the driver's cabin is eerily empty.

This is the Robdozer, a fortified engineering vehicle manned remotely, and in this case operated from a military expo halfway across the globe in Alabama.

Army engineers and military experts say that the Robdozer -- the robotic version of Caterpillar's D9 bulldozer -- is the future of automated combat.

The Israeli military has used D9 for years to carry out frontline tasks like trowelling roads for advancing troops, removing rubble and flattening terrain.

But since war in Gaza broke out in October 2023 and later in Lebanon, the Israeli military has increasingly deployed this robotic version in a bid to enhance its field operations and reduce the risks to its troops.

""The idea is to eliminate the person from the cockpit of the dozer,"" said Rani, whose team at the state-owned Israel Aerospace Industries developed the Robdozer.

During the Gaza war, the military has increasingly opted for the unmanned version, which can carry out a full range of tasks ""even better than a human"", said Rani, using his first name only for security reasons.

While such vehicles and other systems are currently operated by humans, future versions could be autonomous, raising ethical and legal concerns over the unchartered future of warfare being shaped by the Israeli military in the Gaza war.

- 'Changing the paradigm' -

Israel's increasing use of advanced technology on the battlefield, from air defence systems to a broad range of AI-driven intelligence tools, has been well-documented but also criticised for inaccuracies, lack of human oversight and potential violations of international law.

Analysts say the growing Israeli deployment of the Robdozer reflects broader global trends towards automation in heavy combat vehicles, like remote-controlled personnel carriers that operate much like drones.

An Israeli military official, who requested anonymity to discuss sensitive matters, told AFP that the army has been using ""robotic tools for over a decade, but in very small numbers. Now it is being used in large-scale warfare"".

Troops can now operate machinery without having to enter enemy territory, said the official.

Andrew Fox, a retired British army major and a research fellow at the London-based Henry Jackson Society, said the Israeli military was likely the first force to use remote-controlled combat machinery in an active war zone.

""It's a really big development"" that is ""changing the paradigm"" of warfare, carrying out tasks as effectively but at a far reduced risk to personnel, he said.

- New era -

""This is the future,"" said John Spencer, chair of urban warfare studies at the US military's Modern War Institute at West Point.

Many ""have been experimenting with it, but nobody has seen direct deployment into active modern combat,"" he added. ""It is very unique.""

But beyond ethical and legal drawbacks to such advanced technology, there is also the need for an overriding human presence to make decisions particularly in unusual situations.

Hamas's October 7, 2023 attack on Israel that sparked the Gaza war was a disastrous example for that, when Palestinian militants breached the high-security border, said Tal Mimran of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.

""I think that October 7 showed us that you can build a wall that may cost $1 billion, but if you do not patrol the border, then someone will infiltrate your country,"" said Mimran, a lecturer and researcher of international law who has been closely following the Israeli military's technological developments.

""We must take note of the opportunities and of the risks of technology,"" he said.

""This is the era in which artificial intelligence is exploding into our lives, and it is only natural that it will also have a manifestation in the security field.""",['Ruth Eglash'],,https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2025/04/israels-unmanned-bulldozers-breaking-ground-gaza-war,2025-04-20
Trump tariffs: DHL suspends high value US deliveries,"DHL suspends high value US deliveries over tariffs

Previously, packages worth up to $2,500 could enter the US with minimal paperwork but due to tighter customs checks that came into force alongside Trump's tariffs earlier this month, the threshold has been lowered.

It added that business-to-business shipments will still go ahead, ""though they may also face delays"".

The delivery giant said it will temporarily stop shipments from companies in all countries to American consumers on Monday ""until further notice"".

DHL Express is suspending deliveries to the US worth more than $800 (£603) because of a ""significant increase"" in red tape at customs following the intruduction of Donald Trump's new tariff regime.

DHL said that the change ""has caused a surge in formal customs clearances, which we are handling around the clock"".

It said that while it is working to ""scale up and manage this increase, shipments woth over $800, regardless of origin, may experience multi-day delays"".

The company said it will still deliver packages worth less than $800, which can be sent to the US with minimal checks.

But the White House is set to clamp down on deliveries under $800 - specifically those sent from China and Hong Kong - on 2 May when it closes a loophole allowing low-value packages to enter the US without incurring any duties.

The removal of the so-called ""de minimis"" rule will impact the likes of the fast-fashion firm Shein and Temu, the low-cost retail giant.

Shein and Temu have both warned that they will increase prices ""due to recent changes in global trade rules and tariffs"".

The Trump administration has claimed that ""many shippers"" in China ""hide illicit substances and conceal the true contents of shipments sent to the US through deceptive shipping practices"".

Under an excutive order, the White House said the measures were aimed at ""addressing the synthetic opioid supply chain"" which it said ""play a significant role in the synthetic opioid crisis in the US"".

Beijing has said that the opioid fentanyl is a ""US problem"" and China has the strictest drug policies in the world.

Last week, Hongkong Post said it was suspending packages sent to the US by sea and, from 27 April, would stop accepting parcels destined for America.

It said: ""The US is unreasonable, bullying and imposing tariffs abusively.""",[],,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1jx9ep5l63o,2025-04-20
Peter Navarro: The Architect of Trump’s Tariffs,"On a clear day last July in Miami, Peter Navarro emerged from four months in federal prison, where he’d been imprisoned for contempt of Congress.

Just hours after his release from prison, Mr. Navarro flew to Milwaukee to speak at the Republican National Convention in support of Donald J. Trump’s re-election.

“They convicted me, they jailed me. Guess what? They did not break me,” he said that night, punctuating each word as the crowd roared. It was an exercise in loyalty to Mr. Trump that seems to have paid off.

Trump Draft Order Would Drastically Overhaul U.S. State Department,"A draft White House executive order proposes a drastic restructuring of the State Department, including eliminating almost all of its Africa operations and shutting down embassies and consulates across the continent.

The draft also calls for cutting offices at State Department headquarters that address climate change and refugee issues, as well as democracy and human rights concerns.

The purpose of the executive order, which could be signed by President Trump this week, is to impose “a disciplined reorganization” of the State Department and “streamline mission delivery” while cutting “waste, fraud and abuse,” according to a copy of the 16-page draft order obtained by The New York Times. The department is supposed to make the changes by Oct. 1.

The signing of the executive order would be accompanied by efforts to lay off both career diplomats, known as foreign service officers, and civil service employees, who usually work in the department’s headquarters in Washington, said current and former U.S. officials familiar with the plans. The department would begin putting large numbers of workers on paid leave and sending out notices of termination, they said.",['Edward Wong'],2025-04-20,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/20/us/politics/trump-state-department-overhaul.html,2025-04-20

Tunisian court hands prison sentences of up to 66 years in mass trial of regime opponents,"A Tunisian court has handed down prison sentences of 13 to 66 years to politicians, businessmen and lawyers in a mass trial that opponents say is fabricated and a symbol of president Kais Saied’s authoritarian rule.

Businessman Kamel Ltaif received the longest sentence of 66 years on Saturday, while opposition politician Khayam Turki was given a 48-year jail term, a lawyer for the defendants said.

The court also sentenced prominent opposition figures, including Ghazi Chaouachi, Issam Chebbi, Jawahar Ben Mbarek and Ridha Belhaj, to 18 years in prison. They have been in custody since 2023.

Forty people were being prosecuted in the trial that started in March. More than 20 have fled abroad since being charged.

Saied secured a second five-year term in 2024 with 90.7% of the vote after coming to power in 2019. Rights groups say he has had full control over the judiciary since he dissolved parliament in 2021 and began ruling by decree. He dissolved the independent supreme judicial council and sacked dozens of judges in 2022.

“We are not surprised by these unjust and vengeful verdicts that seek to silence the voices of these opposition figures,” Chaouachi’s son Youssef said

“I have never witnessed a trial like this. It’s a farce, the rulings are ready, and what is happening is scandalous and shameful,” said defence lawyer Ahmed Souab on Friday before the ruling was handed down.

Authorities say the defendants, who also include former officials and the former head of intelligence Kamel Guizani, tried to destabilise the country and overthrow Saied.

“The authorities want to criminalise the opposition,” said the leader of the main National Salvation Front opposition coalition, Nejib Chebbi, on Friday. Chebbi was also among the defendants.

Saied said in 2023 the politicians were “traitors and terrorists” and that judges who would acquit them were their accomplices.

The opposition leaders involved in the case accuse Saied of staging a coup in 2021 and say the case is fabricated to stifle the opposition and establish a one-man, repressive rule.

They say they were preparing an initiative aimed at uniting the fragmented opposition to face the democratic setback in the cradle of the Arab spring uprisings.

Welcome back to our live coverage of Russia’s war on Ukraine.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has accused Russia of creating a mere “impression” of a ceasefire as Moscow reportedly continued shelling areas of Ukraine overnight.

In a televised meeting with his commander-in-chief on Saturday, Russian President Vladimir Putin said the temporary ceasefire would last from 6pm Moscow time (4pm BST) on Saturday until midnight (10pm BST) on Sunday.

Putin claimed he had ordered his forces to “stop all military activity” along the frontline during this window for “humanitarian reasons”.

But Zelenskyy said there had been hundreds of instances of shelling on Saturday evening. Early on Sunday, Ukrainian forces reported 59 instances of shelling and five assault attempts along the frontline, he said.

In a post on X, the Ukrainian president wrote:

Overall, as of Easter morning, we can state that the Russian army is attempting to create the general impression of a ceasefire, while in some areas still continuing isolated attempts to advance and inflict losses on Ukraine. Russia must fully comply with the conditions of the ceasefire. Ukraine’s proposal to implement and extend the ceasefire for 30 days after midnight tonight remains on the table. We will act in accordance with the actual situation on the ground.

Previous attempts at holding ceasefires for Easter in April 2022 and Orthodox Christmas in January 2023 were not implemented after both sides failed to agree on them.

How to dismantle democracy: Lessons aspiring autocrats may take from Hungary's Orban,"How to dismantle democracy: Lessons aspiring autocrats may take from Hungary's Orban

BUDAPEST, Hungary — Atop a cobblestone hill overlooking the Danube River and the medieval lanes of Budapest, tour groups surround a changing of the guard ceremony in front of a 13th century baroque castle. Across the square, construction crews rebuild a centuries-old palace complex, and that's where politician Akos Hadhazy guides a tour of his own. ""We are at the Buda Castle, and if you're looking for a symbolic place for corruption, power and the waste of public money, this is a beautiful venue for that,"" Hadhazy says as a Chinese tour group shuffles by.

Hadhazy, who works as a veterinarian, is an independent member of Hungary's parliament. He routinely gives tours showcasing what he and many critics allege is the corruption of Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban's government.

""The offices for the prime minister and his cabinet used to be down there next to the parliament building,"" he continues, pointing to Budapest's other big pointy-towered tourist attraction in the distance, across the river. ""But Orban decided he wanted to move here, into a castle. Even Matyas Rakosi, Hungary's most brutal communist dictator, refused to move his office here, but Orban wants to play king, so the national gallery will eventually need to be moved out of the castle to make way for him.""

All this construction, Hadhazy says, motioning to the cranes towering above the hilltop, represents Orban's gifts to cronies in the form of lucrative contracts while ensuring Orban can survey his ""kingdom"" from above the capital.

Orban, 61, is in his fourth consecutive term as prime minister. In that time, he and his allies have dismantled democratic checks and balances, taken control of the country's media, civil society and universities, and consolidated power in himself and his Fidesz party. The dismantling of Hungary's democracy is a point of fascination for political scientists around the world — including those advising the Trump administration.

But Hadhazy says the Hungarian prime minister is an easy read. ""It's not like Orban is a genius politician,"" he says. ""He received his sheet music from Vladimir Putin, who came into power when oil prices were high, and he channeled that money into oligarchs and in return they bought up Russia's independent media. Orban franchised that model here in Hungary, except he used European Union funds.""

Orban targets the media

The EU began freezing those funds in 2022, but not before Orban and loyal associates took control of much of the country's media.

When the Fidesz party regained power in 2010, ""the first target was the media,"" explains Hungarian investigative journalist Andras Petho. ""Literally the first legislation that they introduced to the parliament was the media law, which, at first, was about redesigning the media regulatory system.""

Petho, who now runs the investigative reporting center Direkt36 in Budapest, says Orban's government was quick to approve any business deal by those close to Orban who wanted to take over media companies. At the same time, Petho says, Orban changed the structure of Hungary's public media outlet, allowing the government to purge the institution of anyone deemed unfriendly to the government.

Petho's former employer Origo, a digital news site, was also sold to a company owned by the son of the then-central bank governor, who, Petho says, eventually turned it into a propaganda site. ""The publisher started coming to us with really unusual requests, asking us to remove articles from the website, and when we tried to push back, things escalated pretty quickly.""

toggle caption Rob Schmitz/NPR

Petho says he and many others in Origo's newsroom resigned.

What's left of Hungary's free press can be found in nooks and crannies that dot the capital. In a tiny apartment in central Budapest, a few dozen journalists from what used to be prominent newspapers that were, one-by-one, forced to shut down by Orban's government have formed their own newspaper — Magyar Hang, or Hungarian Voice.

""Nobody was brave enough to print in Hungary, so we have to find a printing company outside the country,"" says Csaba Lukacs, managing director of the weekly paper. ""Our newspaper is printed in Slovakia in Bratislava, so we have to organize each week the transportation of the paper.""

Hungarian Voice is funded almost entirely through subscriptions, says Lukacs. He says it's the only conservative paper in Hungary that isn't part of the state propaganda apparatus. ""We are not receiving advertising even from multinational companies,"" he says, ""because they are afraid they will be punished by the tax authorities or somebody else, and our journalists are not allowed to go to the government press conferences.""

Lukacs says the government has stripped away press freedom in a step-by-step process over the years.

""We are not yet in Turkey, because the journalists will not be jailed yet,"" he says. ""We are not in Russia because nobody is falling out from the windows yet. But day by day we are getting closer.""

Pressure on Hungary's universities

""What are the characteristics of a dictatorship,"" asks professor Agnes Kende to her students, mostly middle-aged adults at a night class inside a sleek room in Central European University's Budapest campus.

""One person controls power with their family,"" offers Éva Turonyi, a retired healthcare assistant.

""Very good,"" says Kende, writing the point on the board.

""In a dictatorship, the power is centralized, while in a democracy, it's more fragmented,"" says Andrea Kovacs, an assistant at a local construction company.

""Great, centralized power,"" echoes Kende.

""In a dictatorship, elections are made irrelevant,"" offers one of the only men in the class, Jeno Bak.

""Interesting point,"" says Kende. ""Let me ask: Does anyone in a dictatorship have the right to vote?""

Bak, in his 60s, shoots up his hand and Kende calls on him. ""I had the right to vote, even in the Kadar era,"" he says, referring to communist dictator Janos Kadar, who ruled Hungary for 32 years during the Cold War. ""It didn't have much of a point because you only could pick from a single option. We acted out the 'democracy.' ""

After the brainstorming session, the class breaks into small groups, where they analyze key speeches delivered by Stalin, Hitler, Mao, and other dictators throughout modern history. The class is part of the Socrates Program at Central European University, one of the few programs still offering classes at the institution's Budapest site. CEU was forced to move its degree programs from Budapest to a new campus in Vienna after Orban's government pushed a law through parliament in 2017 that changed rules for foreign universities operating in Hungary.

""In spite of everything,"" says CEU Budapest Pro-Rector Laszlo Kontler, ""we are determined to continue useful work here with all civil society stakeholders, academic partners that have been accumulated over three decades, and with whom the connections are not completely lost.""

Kontler, a history professor, says Orban's government has not only forced out foreign universities like CEU, but in the 2010s, it took over state universities by appointing chancellors who had a wide scope of authority over the institutions' finances. ""So that's one step,"" Laszlo says, ""if you will, against the academic autonomy of institutions.""

Another step, he says, was, under the direction of Orban, state universities ""were privatized in a very particular way"" — placed under the direction of boards that were packed with individuals close to Orban's Fidesz party. ""They have been promised to be put on a financially more viable footing in exchange for accepting basically control or surveillance by a combination of individuals and forces close to the government,"" explains Laszlo.

The institutions that accepted this government control include some of Hungary's oldest and largest universities such as Corvinus University, Moholy-Nagy University of Art and Design, and Semmelweis University.

""There are excellent academics who are doing academically credible work at these universities as well,"" Kontler points out, ""but still, there are strange things happening, which, if one puts it together, cannot be regarded as anything else than an infringement on academic authority.""

""Trump went further in two months than Orban could in 15 years""

This year, faced with an increasingly unified opposition in parliament that has rallied behind charismatic lawyer and politician Peter Magyar, Orban's attacks on media, civil society and freedom of assembly have gained momentum. On March 15, in a speech commemorating Hungary's 1848 revolution against the Habsburg empire, Orban said, ""We are dismantling the financial machine that has used corrupt dollars to buy politicians, judges, journalists, bogus civil society organizations and political activists.""

toggle caption Balint Szentgallay/NurPhoto via Getty Images

He called these groups stink bugs who have ""survived the winter"" and need to be eradicated. ""If there is justice, and there is, there is a special place in hell for them,"" Orban said.

Political scientist Peter Kreko says Orban is targeting the last bastions of Western democracy in Hungary. ""Orban just thinks that the West is unable to survive and the democratic and liberal practices of the West have weakened the West,"" he says.

Kreko has mapped out the 15-year process Orban has taken to dismantle Hungary's democracy. Orban began, he says, by weakening Hungary's courts, filling them with loyalists. He then applied pressure on media companies, either turning them into state propaganda or putting them out of business. Then, says Kreko, Orban took control over universities, appointing leaders loyal to him.

Kreko says Orban focused on ridding Hungary of any institution capable of checking his power, and he says he sees similarities to how President Trump is carrying out his second term in office. The difference, says Kreko, is the pace at which Trump is operating. ""I think Trump went further in two months than Orban could in 15 years,"" observers Kreko. ""In the United States, it reminds me of a constitutional coup, where everything happens very rapidly.""

In public speeches, Trump has called Orban ""fantastic,"" ""respected"" and said ""nobody is a better leader"" than the Hungarian prime minister. And while Orban has boasted that his party has shared his strategies with Trump advisers, Kreko doubts the help was very meaningful. He says Hungary serves as more of a conservative fantasyland that MAGA Republicans can aspire to. ""So: Hungary as the country where you don't have immigrants, where you don't have woke issues, where gender ideology is not that dominant,"" says Kreko, ""and where family values are strong. So this is clearly a construction of Hungary that has nothing to do with reality.""

toggle caption Rob Schmitz/NPR

He says that's because Hungary is surrounded by Europe and its open society. Budapest's annual Pride Parade, one of Europe's largest, is now in the Hungarian government's crosshairs. In March, it pushed a new law through parliament that banned any assembly that ""promotes homosexuality,"" asserting it was needed to ""protect children."" On April 14, the parliament voted to amend the country's constitution with similar language.

At a café in Budapest, Pride Parade spokesperson Johanna Majercsik says this new law will likely go further than banning the pride parade. ""If the government succeeds in banning such a peaceful protest, that means that in the future they will be able to ban or restrict any other peaceful event, any other peaceful demonstration organized by [other] social groups,"" she says.

Many other Hungarians agree. After the public assembly law passed in March, tens of thousands of people halted traffic and bridges in the capital in what have become weekly protests in Budapest. Critics of the law and the new constitutional amendment say Orban is using the LGBTQ+ community as a tool to shut down the right of Hungarian citizens to freely assemble in peaceful protests, particularly at a time when the opposition to Orban's rule is beginning to gain momentum.

But political analysts say Orban, nearing the end of his fourth consecutive term, appears to be, yet again, adapting his step-by-step strategy to hold on to power for as long as he can.

"Soyuz MS-26 spacecraft brings NASA, Russia astronauts back to earth","Landing on the steppes of Kazakhstan coincides with US astronaut Donald Pettit’s 70th birthday.

Russian astronauts Alexey Ovchinin and Ivan Wagner have returned to Earth along with American Donald Pettit after a seven-month science mission on board the International Space Station (ISS).

The Russian Soyuz MS-26 spacecraft carrying the trio touched down southeast of the town of Dzhezkazgan, Kazakhstan, at 6:20am (01:20 GMT) on Sunday, the landing confirmed by the United States’s NASA and Russia’s Roscosmos space agency.

The timing of their parachute-assisted return to Earth coincided with the US astronaut’s 70th birthday, NASA said on the social media platform X.

Happy birthday, @astro_Pettit! Many happy returns (including this one) 🥳 The MS-26 Soyuz spacecraft touched down in Kazakhstan at 9:20pm ET—or, in local time, 6:20am April 20, Pettit's 70th birthday. pic.twitter.com/qFM5fAxnA0 — NASA (@NASA) April 20, 2025

NASA said the crew was moved to a recovery staging area in the city of Karaganda, adding that Pettit was doing well.

The crew arrived on the orbiting ISS laboratory on September 11, 2024, spending 220 days in space during which they orbited the Earth 3,520 times, completing a journey of 93.3 million miles (150.15 million km), NASA said in a statement.

Pettit spent his time researching “in-orbit metal 3D printing capabilities” and “water sanitisation technologies” while exploring plant growth and fire behaviour in space.

This was Pettit’s fourth spaceflight, with a total of 590 days in orbit logged throughout his career. Ovchinin has notched up 595 days in space over four flights, while Wagner has reached a total of 416 days over two flights.

Space exploration has remained a rare avenue of cooperation between the US and Russia since the latter unleashed its war in Ukraine in February 2022.

Earlier this month, the Soyuz MS-27 spacecraft carried another US-Russia crew – NASA’s Jonathan Kim and Russian crewmates Sergei Ryzhikov and Alexei Zubritsky – to carry out scientific experiments on the ISS.

However, the US and other Western countries have ceased other partnerships with Roscosmos as part of a slew of sanctions placed on Russia over the war.

"Who is Carlo Acutis, the computer prodigy who died at 15 and is to be first millennial saint?","He was a London-born teenager with leukaemia who spread his faith by building websites, later gaining the moniker “God’s influencer”.

And now Carlo Acutis, a computer prodigy who died at the age of 15 in 2006, will become the first millennial canonised by the Catholic church next week, in St Peter’s Square.

Acutis used the computer coding languages he learned in primary school to develop websites for his parish and the wider church, including one that tracked Catholic miracles.

The Vatican has a path towards sainthood, which can only begin five years after a person’s death. The Holy See studies the person’s life, and keeps watch for the miracles necessary to secure a spot among the beatific.

Acutis was put on the path after Pope Francis approved a miracle attributed to him: a seven-year-old boy from Brazil recovered from a rare pancreatic disorder after coming into contact with one of Acutis’s T-shirts. A priest had also prayed to Acutis on behalf of the child.

If a person undergoes an unexpected recovery, it can be classed as a miracle by the Vatican. If two miracles are attributed to a deceased person and approved by the pope, then they qualify for sainthood.

Acutis’s sainthood was confirmed when the pope approved the second miracle: a 21-year-old student in Costa Rica made a swift recovery after head trauma from a serious bicycle accident after her mother prayed for her daughter’s recovery at Acutis’s tomb in the Umbrian town of Assisi.

As part of the pathway, Acutis’s body was moved to the hill town of Assisi in central Italy, in line with his last wishes, since he admired Saint Francis.

Acutis was entombed in Santa Maria Maggiore church with a wax mould of his likeness placed over his body, wearing his blue tracksuit top, jeans and trainers.

Ever since, crowds have been gathering at the clear-sided casket. Tens of thousands more are expected to attend the canonisation service on 27 April. Vatican officials hope that the pope, who is recovering from a serious bout of double pneumonia, will preside.

Out of 912 people canonised by Pope Francis, the most recent birth date was previously 1926.

Acutis was born in London in 1991 before moving to Milan with his Italian parents, Andrea Acutis and Antonia Salzano, as a child.

Salzano previously told the newspaper Corriere della Sera that from the age of three her son would ask to visit churches they passed in Milan and would donate his pocket money to poor people in the city.

She said Acutis would also offer to support classmates whose parents were going through divorces, would defend disabled peers when they were bullied and would take meals and sleeping bags to rough sleepers in Milan.

She told Reuters that he was special, but also shared the same anxieties about fitting in as any other teenager: “Carlo was an ordinary child like [others]. He used to play, to have friends, and to go to school. But his extraordinary quality was the fact that he opened the door of his heart to Jesus and put Jesus in the first place in his life.”

She said her son lived an ascetic life in which he would not allow himself more than one pair of shoes at a time.",['Rachel Hall'],2025-04-20,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/20/who-is-carlo-acutis-the-computer-prodigy-who-died-at-15-and-is-to-be-first-millennial-saint,2025-04-20

Peaceful picnic marks ‘420 Day’ in Melbourne – ahead of an election where minor parties could play a defining role,"More than a hundred peaceful picnickers gathered on the green grass of Melbourne’s Flagstaff Gardens support of the legalisation of cannabis on Sunday.

This year, the annual 20 April global celebration of cannabis (known as “420”), landed during a federal campaign in which independents and minor parties are expected to play a defining role.

The Legalise Cannabis party’s lead senate candidate for Victoria, Fiona Patten, said the focus of the Sunday event was “celebrating cannabis” and calling for a change to laws that criminalise the use and possession of marijuana for recreational purposes.

It was mostly a relaxed affair. Attendees reclined on blankets beneath a large Moreton Bay fig, as campaigners for the Legalise Cannabis party and the Libertarian party handed out pamphlets and how-to-vote cards. A juggler flipped fluorescent orange clubs into the air, while 50 or so police – and their sniffer dogs – watched from the sidelines.

Patten, who previously represented the Reason party and the Australian Sex party in the Victorian parliament, had not planned to run for federal politics, but she had “unfinished business”, she said, especially in relation to drug law reform.

4:48 Voting 101: Who are the Australian political parties clamouring for your vote? – video

Legalise Cannabis Australia performed strongly at the 2022 federal election, gaining between 2% and 7% of the Senate vote in most states and the Northern Territory, on a platform that seeks to decriminalise and regulate personal use, and see cannabis treated similarly to alcohol and tobacco.

If elected in 2025, Patton hopes to achieve two key actions.

One is a “root-and-branch review” of the medicinal cannabis program and regulations in Australia, addressing the barriers to patients, farmers and manufacturers.

The second is to amend the federal Crimes Act, enabling states and territories to legalise and regulate cannabis without the risk of being overruled by the commonwealth.

“Prime minister Albanese says cannabis regulation is a matter for the states – we have to amend the federal act to enable that to happen,” Patten said.

By running for the Legalise Cannabis party, she also hopes to block candidates such as Ralph Babet, the United Australia party candidate who claimed the sixth Victorian senate seat at the last election.

“I feel really determined to stop that from happening,” she said. “My race is not with the Greens. It’s not with the Labor party. My race is with One Nation and the Trumpet of Patriots.”

In Australia, the use of marijuana for medicinal and scientific purposes has been legal since 2016, whereas recreational use remains largely illegal across much of the country, except for the Australian Capital Territory.

Despite its status, cannabis was the most widely used illicit drug in Australia, used by 11.5% of people, according to the latest data from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare.

“The fact that 2.4 million of us are using cannabis, yet its prohibited, shows that its a bad law, that discriminates against people and stigmatises people,” Patten said.

More than 80% of Australians aged over 14 did not think possessing cannabis should be a criminal offence, a national survey of more than 21,000 people held in 2022-23 found.

A University of Sydney study, published in the journal Addiction, found rates of cannabis poisoning increased after legalisation in other countries, with risks to children associated with edibles highlighted as a particular concern.

But Patten said legalisation would enable both regulation and education: “One of the main reasons for regulating and legalising a product that is so popular is that you can reduce harm that may be associated with it.”

Many in attendance on Sunday, like Shane Macarthur from Traralgon and Jacob Trounce of Geelong, had travelled long distances to show their support for those fighting to change laws that criminalised recreational use.

Most questioned the visible presence of police. Sharon Tavener, from Frankston, said she thought the police were intimidating and unnecessary, when what people wanted was the ability to come together peacefully, have a joint and enjoy each other’s company.",['Petra Stock'],2025-04-20,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/apr/20/peaceful-picnic-marks-420-day-in-melbourne-ahead-of-an-election-where-minor-parties-could-play-a-defining-role,2025-04-20

Gaza father grieves for children killed in Israeli airstrike on church building,"As people take a break for the Easter holiday, in the Gaza Strip there is no respite from the 18-month-long war with Israel.

Gaza has a tiny Christian community of Greek Orthodox Christians, Catholics, Evangelicals, and Anglicans.

For Ramez al-Souri, the pain is unimaginable. His three children were killed by an Israeli airstrike, on an annex of Gaza's Saint Porphyrius Greek Orthodox Church.

Palestinian health officials say the attack on 19 October 2023 killed 18 people inside the building.

""My home has changed completely because there are no smiles, no laughter, no joy,"" Mr Al-Souri says.

""I lost my flower - my daughter Julie - and my boys Suhail and Majd. They were salt of the Earth.""

Shrouded in darkness

Julia was 12 years old, Suhial 14 and Majd 11.

It is a loss that never leaves Mr Al-Souri, and one shared by almost every family in Gaza.

Walking through the cemetery, he gently places a small bouquet of flowers on his children's grave. Gunfire crackles in the distance. The neighbourhood is full of rubble and destruction.

""This Easter is no different than the last,"" Mr Al-Souri says.

""We are tending to our wounds.

""We continue to hope for an end to this war and suffering, for the darkness over Gaza to finally lift.""

Israel is calling for Hamas to disarm and to release 10 Israeli hostages in exchange for a 45-day ceasefire.

Hamas has rejected the proposal. It argues Israel reneged on the first ceasefire deal by refusing to move to phase two of the agreement and withdraw Israeli troops from the Gaza Strip.

A disaster on the ground

Since the ceasefire collapsed on 2 March, Israel's bombing campaign has intensified.

Palestinian health officials say more than 1,700 people have been killed in the last month, and more than 90 people in the last 24 hours.

The humanitarian situation is a disaster. At the few remaining soup kitchens in Gaza, children scramble for food. They carry pots for their family and push forward trying to secure a bowl of lentils or rice.

Israel has blocked aid trucks from entering for the last seven weeks. It says it is to put pressure on Hamas.

But the pressure is being felt by civilians, creating what aid groups say is the most severe crisis Gaza has ever faced.

Israel has cut off vital supplies of food and medicine, but insists it is not using starvation as a weapon of war. It rejects any suggestion Gaza does not have enough food and accuses Hamas of stealing it.

Thousands gather for centuries-old Holy Fire ceremony in Jerusalem,"Thousands of Christians gathered in the cavernous Church of the Holy Sepulchre for a centuries-old Holy Fire ceremony.

Holding unlit candles, they packed into the sprawling 12th-century basilica built on the site where, according to tradition, Jesus was crucified and buried.

In near-total darkness, the Greek patriarch entered the Holy Edicule and emerged with two lit candles. The flame was passed from one candle to the next, the light overcoming the darkness in the rotunda. The flame was later transferred to Orthodox communities in other countries on special flights.

Eastern Orthodox Christians believe the light miraculously appears inside the Holy Edicule, built on the traditional site of Jesus’s tomb, while sceptics going back to the Middle Ages have dismissed it as a carnival trick for the masses.

Either way, the ceremony, which goes back at least 1,200 years, is a sight to behold. It has also ignited safety concerns.

In 1834, a frenzied stampede broke out in the darkened church, and the ruler of the Holy Land at the time barely escaped after his guards drew swords and hacked their way through the crowd, historian Simon Sebag Montefiore recounts in his history of Jerusalem. Some 400 pilgrims died in the melee, most from suffocation or trampling.

Israeli authorities have sought to limit participants in recent years, citing safety concerns. That has drawn protests from church leaders, who have accused them of upsetting the delicate, unwritten arrangements around Jerusalem’s holy sites known as the status quo.

On Saturday, there was a heavy military presence as thousands of worshippers passed through Israeli checkpoints to enter.

Some worshippers lamented that the turnout lacked numbers this year because of Israel’s 18-month war on Gaza. “The number of police is higher than the number of pilgrims,” said Adeeb Joude, key holder for the Holy Sepulchre.

Israel captured East Jerusalem, including the Old City with major sites sacred to Jews, Christians and Muslims, in the 1967 Middle East War, and annexed it in a move not recognised internationally. The Palestinians want East Jerusalem to be the capital of their future state.

The Old City has a long history of tensions between Israelis and Palestinians, among different religious groups that share its hilly confines and even within certain faiths. Perceived infringements on the status quo in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre have led to brawls between monks of different denominations.

Israel says it is committed to ensuring freedom of worship for Jews, Christians and Muslims, and has long presented itself as an island of tolerance in the Middle East.

In recent years, however, tensions have risen with the local Christian community, most of whom are Palestinian Christians, a population that has dwindled through decades of conflict as many have moved abroad.",[],2025-04-20,https://www.aljazeera.com/gallery/2025/4/20/thousands-gather-for-centuries-old-holy-fire-ceremony-in-jerusalem?traffic_source=rss,2025-04-20

The Business Playbook for Tariff Chaos,"That kind of loss is easier to stomach if it’s a one-time thing.

Lee Mayer manages Havenly, a collection of home décor brands. To mitigate tariff risk, she has been working for months to relocate her production to Vietnam and Cambodia from China. But one last shipment didn’t make it out of China before the new duties hit. The boat is now on its way to the United States, and it will carry a tariff bill of at least $2 million when it arrives.

“It’s pretty painful,” Ms. Mayer said. “That’s two to three million we won’t be able to reinvest elsewhere.” She’s just hoping that tariffs on the countries that now make her furniture won’t end up going into effect after Mr. Trump’s 90-day pause. “I’m a bit worried that it’s just a game of Whac-a-Mole at this point,” she said.

Batten down the hatches

Even for those with healthy profits, paying more in tariffs generally means spending less on something else. That could mean deciding to not lease a larger space, pay for advertising, buy new equipment or hire a new sales associate.

Some can cut costs through automation. Others will end up letting people go. Kelsey O’Callaghan is one of the owners of a company, Dorai Home, that imports kitchen and bathroom products made from a special quick-drying material from China, and she has searched fruitlessly for viable suppliers in the United States.

Inside the Urgent Fight Over the Trump Administration’s New Deportation Effort,"On Thursday evening, lawyers helping Venezuelan immigrants most at risk of being removed under an 18th-century wartime powers act received an ominous alert: U.S. immigration officials were handing out notices at a detention facility in Texas, informing migrants that they were considered enemies under the law and would be removed from the country.

“I am a law enforcement officer authorized to apprehend, restrain and remove alien enemies,” read the notice, a copy of which was filed in federal court by the American Civil Liberties Union. “Accordingly, under the Alien Enemies Act, you have been determined to be an alien enemy subject to apprehension, restraint and removal from the United States.”

The notice said the migrant could make a phone call but did not specify to whom. The single-page notice also did not mention any way to appeal the order.

The Supreme Court ruled this month that migrants must receive advance notice that they are subject to removal under the rarely invoked wartime powers law — and that they must have an opportunity to challenge their removal in court.","['Hamed Aleaziz', 'Alan Feuer', 'Annie Correal']",2025-04-19,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/19/us/politics/trump-deportation-courts-venezuelan-migrants-texas.html,2025-04-20
Zelensky says Russian attacks ongoing despite 'Easter truce',"Attacks continue despite Putin's 'Easter truce' pledge, Zelensky says

Russia's defence ministry insisted all Russian forces had been adhering to the truce and accused Ukraine's army of breaking it.

Putin ordered his forces to ""stop all military activity"" in Ukraine from 18:00 Moscow time (16:00 BST) on Saturday until midnight on Sunday. Kyiv said it would also adhere.

In the first six hours of the ""Easter truce"" - as ordered by Russian President Vladimir Putin - Zelensky said there had been 387 shellings and 19 assaults by Russian forces, and drones used 290 times. There are no reports of casualties.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has accused Russia of creating an ""impression"" of a ceasefire while still taking military actions in some places in Ukraine.

Russia said Ukrainian units fired at the positions of Russian troops 444 times, carried out 900 strikes with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), 12 shellings, 33 strikes by UAVs and seven drops of munitions. The ministry said there were dead and wounded among the civilian population. It did not give any details.

Zelensky on Sunday morning said Moscow was ""trying to create a general impression of a ceasefire, but in some places it does not abandon individual attempts to advance and inflict losses on Ukraine.""

Accusing Russia of specific military actions, Zelensky added that ""everywhere our warriors are responding as the enemy deserves, based on the specific combat situation.""

Because Putin's ceasefire was announced minutes before it was due to take effect, an immediate, complete pause was always unlikely, but the BBC in Ukraine reports it has been quieter on the front lines.

Before Zelensky said there had been continued attacks in some areas, at midnight on Saturday there were no reported Russian drones or fighter jets in Ukrainian skies.

That is very rare.

The only report was that a Russian ship with missile launchers had been deployed to the Black Sea.

In the southern city of Odesa, it was silent. On Friday, before Moscow's announcement, air defences crackled throughout the night as Russian drones flew in from the direction of occupied Crimea.

Late on Saturday - hours into the truce - Zelensky had said: ""If Russia is now suddenly ready to truly engage in a format of full and unconditional silence, Ukraine will act accordingly - mirroring Russia's actions.""

""Our actions are and will be symmetrical. The proposal for a full and unconditional 30-day silence remains on the table — the answer to it must come from Moscow,"" he wrote on X.

Zelensky said Ukraine would be ready to extend a truce beyond 20 April, seemingly referring to an earlier proposal from the US for a 30-day ceasefire which Ukraine had already agreed to.

It seems now both Moscow and Kyiv want to show Washington they are serious about peace. The question of whether the Kremlin accepts Zelensky's offer to turn this truce from a 30-hour one to a 30 day one is central to any potential path to peace.

Few Ukrainians think that is remotely possible.

Putin announced the temporary truce at a meeting with his chief of general staff, Valery Gerasimov.

""Based on humanitarian considerations... the Russian side announces an Easter truce. I order a stop to all military activities for this period,"" Putin told Gerasimov.

""We assume that Ukraine will follow our example. At the same time, our troops should be prepared to repel possible violations of the truce and provocations by the enemy, any aggressive actions.""

The Russian defence ministry said its troops would adhere to the ceasefire provided it was ""mutually respected"" by Ukraine.

It is not the first time a pause in fighting has been suddenly announced - a previous attempt at a ceasefire during Orthodox Christmas in January 2023 fell apart after both sides failed to agree on a proposal.

Reacting to Putin's truce announcement, a Foreign Office spokesman in the UK said: ""Now is the moment for Putin to truly show he is serious about peace by ending his horrible invasion and committing to a full ceasefire, as the Ukrainian government has called for - not just a one day pause for Easter.""",[],,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c787v5gxny7o,2025-04-20

Macron to beat Trump to UK state visit - report,"Emmanuel Macron will reportedly be given a state visit to the UK before Donald Trump's expected visit in September.

The French president received an invitation from the King to travel to the UK at the end of May, according to The Sunday Times.

The paper said few government and royal officials know the details of the engagement, which would be Mr Macron's first state visit to Britain and come eight years after he took office.

'Trump-fest'

It comes after Mr Trump suggested Buckingham Palace was ""setting a date for September"" for him to meet the King.

He said: ""They're going to do a second, as you know, a second fest … that's what it is: a fest, and it's beautiful, and it's the first time it's ever happened to one person.""

Previously, US presidents who have already made a state visit, such as George W Bush and Barack Obama, usually have tea or lunch with the monarch at Windsor Castle.

But Sir Keir Starmer handed Mr Trump what he described as a ""truly historic"" personal invitation from the King for a second state visit when he visited the White House in February.

Reports suggest the venue is expected to be Windsor Castle, rather than Balmoral or Dumfries House, as previously thought.

Mr Macron's visit is also expected to take place at Windsor due to refurbishment at Buckingham Palace.

Sir Keir has repeatedly insisted he does not need to choose between pursuing a closer relationship with Europe and strengthening US-UK trade.

Chancellor Rachel Reeves is expected to speak with her American counterparts next week about the prospect of a wider economic agreement to alleviate the impact of Mr Trump's 10% tariffs on all goods entering America.

But ministers have said Britain must look at co-ordinating better across Europe in order to protect the country's economy.

5h ago 04.43 BST Independent candidate in safe Labor seat campaigning on Palestinian state The independent candidate for Watson in Sydney, Dr Ziad Basyouny, is calling for the establishment of “a unified, pluralist, democratic state in historic Palestine where all live as equal citizens”, in a foreign policy move that the Muslim candidate says is a world-first. Basyouny is taking on the very safe Labor seat on 3 May, held by the home affairs minister, Tony Burke. In a campaign statement released today, he called for a unified, democratic Palestine, the right of return and reparations for Palestinian refugees, and “targeted sanctions against entities complicit in human rights abuses in occupied Palestine”, as well as “international engagement to address mass atrocities in Sudan, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and Myanmar” and investment in peacebuilding, reconciliation and refugee support. “We will no longer accept the double standards of global politics,” Basyouny said.

7h ago 03.12 BST PM tells podcast he’s trying to ‘bring people together’ Anthony Albanese says that he has “consciously tried to bring people together and to reduce conflict” while Peter Dutton has tried to “undermine” and fit into a zeitgeist of strength. Speaking on podcast The Rest is Politics, the PM said that criticisms he faced of being “weak” were in the style of his opponent. Without naming Donald Trump, he alluded to a new and alienating “machismo” in world politics: “In part, that’s the style of Peter Dutton with his cheer squad in the media, as well, will repeat those comments in order to try to undermine and to try to fit into what Peter Dutton thought was the zeitgeist, if you like, of strength, channelling some other world leaders … bringing a machismo, essentially, to politics, and that is something that I think alienates the center,” he said. In the conversation recorded on Saturday evening – which has received some local attention – Albanese told hosts Alastair Campbell and Rory Stewart that politics in Australia was “different”. “We have compulsory voting, and people do go and vote, and there’s record numbers on the electoral roll. You win elections from either the center left or the center right … We’ll see how it plays out over the next couple of weeks, but certainly Peter Dutton has gone out of his way to appeal to a right-wing base, and there isn’t too much that is there for the center,” Albanese said.

7h ago 02.36 BST Economists issue letter calling for clean energy, not nuclear An open letter from 60 Australian economists has rejected the Coalition’s nuclear energy plan, promoting instead the subsidising of household clean energy policies, including incentives for home battery storage. The organiser of the letter, Gareth Bryant, an associate professor in political economy at the University of Sydney, says the letter is intended as an intervention in the election campaign, reports AAP. “As economists, energy analysts and policy specialists we strongly support government investment in household clean energy and industrial electrification and not in nuclear energy,” the letter says. It says simple household clean energy upgrades can deliver immediate cost-of-living benefits and reductions in carbon emissions, and electrification can safeguard the future of industrial jobs and the communities that rely on them. The economists, from a range of Australian universities and other tertiary institutions, said the construction of nuclear power plants would take at least 15 years at a cost of at least $330bn: It would result in higher household energy costs, drain investment away from renewable energy and energy-intensive manufacturing, and leave the Australian economy precariously over-dependent on increasingly automated mineral extraction. The economists said they support a nationwide program to upgrade homes and industry with clean renewable energy. They said the technologies to fund should include large-scale home electrification with smart appliances to provide bill savings, energy-efficiency upgrades and battery storage, which can save surplus solar for night-time use, and hot water retrofits for more efficient water heating.

8h ago 01.45 BST Dan Jervis-Bardy Greens taking ‘nothing for granted’ in campaign to retain seats, says Bandt Adam Bandt was then pushed on whether he still thinks Australia – under prime minister Anthony Albanese – is complicit in a genocide in Gaza. “I think Australia is engaging in a two-way arms trade with Israel,” he replied. (For the record: the government denies this.) Bandt was asked again if the Greens have “dropped” the line about the government being complicit in genocide. When you see a genocide occurring, as Amnesty International as the experts are saying, then you want the Australian government to actually do something, to speak out for peace. Finally, Bandt was asked about the Greens’ prospects on 3 May and whether he’s confident of holding the three Brisbane seats it won in 2022 (Brisbane, Griffith and Ryan). Having been through this myself (defending the seat of Melbourne for the first time), I know the first time around, you take nothing for granted. You have to work incredibly hard.

"Can Trump Really Negotiate Peace in Ukraine, Russians Wonder","Many Russians cheered President Trump’s election because they thought he could make a deal for a negotiated peace in Ukraine that would satisfy the Kremlin.

Three months into Mr. Trump’s second term, the disappointment in Moscow is palpable.

In interviews, people in the Kremlin’s orbit have revealed frustration both with Mr. Trump’s whirlwind approach to the talks and with President Vladimir V. Putin’s apparent inflexibility in the negotiations. With Mr. Trump and his top diplomat warning on Friday that the United States could walk away from the discussion, some of them fear that a collapse in talks could lead to a further escalation of the fighting.

Movement toward peace is going “much more slowly than it should be, and not the way one would want it to be,” said Grigory A. Yavlinsky, a liberal politician in Moscow who held a rare meeting with Mr. Putin in 2023 to urge a cease-fire. In the meantime, he said, Mr. Putin “is just fighting, he’s seizing the moment. He wants to achieve the maximum before substantive talks.”

The question now is whether Mr. Putin climbs down from demands that seem little changed from the cease-fire conditions he outlined last summer, when he said Ukraine would have to agree not to join NATO and also withdraw from a large swath of territory before Russia stopped fighting.",['Anton Troianovski'],2025-04-19,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/19/world/europe/russia-ukraine-putin-trump.html,2025-04-20
